# DataFromAOI
As part of the 2022 NASA GLOBE internship, interns were tasked with analyzing their Area of Intereest (AOI) through Collect Earth Online to eventually compare manual landcover analysis with AI generated classifications. However, many plots were incomplete or disorganized so this project was meant to summarize how many plots were successfully completed and 
would eventually like to compare to classifications made by ESA's Worldcover, the first comprehensive, high resolution global landcover map available to the public.
